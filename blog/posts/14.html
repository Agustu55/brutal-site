    <p class="title">A RESET AND RE-INTRODUCTION</p>
    <p class="date">February 20 2022</p>
<p>
Well, it’s been a while since I’ve last posted. A little over 2 months to be exact. In the fall I had a goal of posting weekly and clearly that didn’t work out since my last post was in December… Since starting this blog I’ve found that writing and storytelling are challenging for me, I struggle to come up with new topics and I lose motivation to post quickly. With that said I’m reinstating my goal to post once a week, and even if my posts are brief, I hope that getting something out there for you all to read will be better than nothing. So per the title of this post, I’m going to reset and re-introduce myself to kick off the new CONSISTENT chapter of the blog.

So that's me and it’s the picture that I use for my Instagram profile and is probably one of my favorite photos of myself. My younger sister took it when she first started getting into film photography, a little over 1.5 yrs ago.

I got into film photography 2ish years ago. Maybe a little earlier and I have been in love with it ever since. That photo of the pawn shop is from March 2020 and it's one of the first photos that I distinctly remember taking, it was shot with my (not so trusty) Nikon FG during a huge snowstorm in SLC. Since that photo I have taken 1,000’s of other photos on a handful of different film cameras. Last year I decided to create this blog to talk about some of the cameras that I've used, my expereiences within the film world and everything in between. If you want to know more about why I started this blog here's the very first posts: <a href="../1.html">POST 001</a>
<br><br>
That post talks about getting into film, my first camera, why I wanted to start a blog etc… This post will serve as another introduction, but I don’t want to say the exact same thing as my first post, so I’ll focus on myself and what I like to shoot. This will be a more encompassing introduction of myself within film rather than an introduction of my first experiences with film.

I live in Salt Lake City, Utah, ever since I discovered photography, I have been fascinated by street photography, the works of Bruce Gilden, Saul Leiter, Joel Meyerowitz and so many of the other greats. But SLC’s meager downtown proved to be uneventful, small and most of the time uninteresting. This definitely is a poor excuse NOT to pursue street photography, but I’ve found that while I’m in SLC my focus and style tends to be towards suburban and rural scenes. For me the places outside and around downtown SLC are more interesting, and this type of suburban photography is how I would define my style.

I don’t have a long term goal with photography. I love being a part of photography communities on Instagram and twitter and I enjoy sharing my work on social platforms, and recently I have been ~enjoying~ sharing my work in blog posts. I put enjoying in these things ‘~’ because as difficult as it has been to write these posts I really really like taking the time to share my work. Perhaps it is a detriment to not have clear long term goals with photography but I’m still just enjoying the journey and don’t see a reason to put pressure on something that I find fun!
Pretty much my only goal at this point is to post a blog once a week to share more with you guys… and to get 25k IG followers so I can justify a NYC trip (but that’s kind of my low key selfish goal).

Oh and I can’t forget that I also LOVE road trip photography. This is hands down my favorite way to take photos. And I cannot wait to share those adventures with you!

As always thanks for reading! And see you next week (for sure this time).
