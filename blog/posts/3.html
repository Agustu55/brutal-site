  I really started shooting film in the spring of 2020. My first film photo in my Lightroom catalog is dated March 4, 2020, so I’ll count that as the start of my film obsession. Of course, that photo was not my first on film. My very first images were taken on a cheap Fujifilm disposable that my parents had bought me for a family trip to Nicaragua in 2007. Most of that roll contained pictures of my sister showing off her stuffed animal collection and blurry scenes through the rental car window.
  <br><br>
  Those photos are a little too far from the present to be included in my recent film renaissance. They were taken back when a disposable camera could be bought for $8 and developed and printed by Costco on the same day… I was too young to appreciate film back then &colon;&lpar;

  If we jump to the present, I am obsessed film.
  <br><br>
  I love the nostalgic effect of film and enjoy the slower manual process of capturing an image. The prices, however, are crippling. It is an expensive hobby, but one that I don’t think I can stop doing. Making a film photograph is truly an incredible experience. There are not many things that I can do which will distract my mind in such a way... take me to another place if you will. And on a realistic note, it is the only thing that I have felt passionate enough to blog about.

  Now let’s go back to the start of it all... sometime in the spring of last year. The image above is from my first roll on my first camera. It was shot on a Nikon FG that I overpaid for through eBay with some expired Kodak UltraMax 400 that I bought from an Amazon seller. I really didn’t have any where or how to buy film things. They were shot through an old Nikon 50mm f2 AI-S lens and scanned with a Plustek scanner that was available for students at the University of Utah.

  My first roll was mostly random pictures of my roommates and around my old house. None of them were particularly amazing, but it was my first time using a film camera. And even though I've shot digital before I had no idea how film would turn out.
  My expectations for my first 24 frames were that everything would be underexposed and blurry. But that didn’t happen, some of them came out, so I was stoked.

  Full disclosure though... in January 2020 there were two pictures that I took with my ex-girlfriends Minotla SRT 201. I'm pretty sure those didn't turn out at all. The camera’s meter was broken, and it was a bright snowy day, which is very challenging to meter for even with a functional meter. I’ve never seen those pictures since we broke up before she developed the roll, but I anticipate that both photos are overexposed barely recognizable blurry scenes of a snowy desert landscape. I’m bummed that I’ve never seen those photos but c’est la vie.

  There were definitely a few frames in that first roll that I messed up and I have far from high hopes for the Minolta ones.. but I'm okay with that because I think it's okay to mess up with film. Perhaps I’m glorifying my own mistakes, but I think messing up film is part of the experience... and maybe adds significance to the medium??
  <br><br>
  It sucks to get scans back and discover that you messed up a shot. It kills me to know that I messed up and can never go back to recreate that exact moment. A missed opportunity that is out of my control. But a scan comes back properly exposed, sharp and in focus then it is even more incredible to know that that moment was successfully captured on film, forever.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another disclamer... I have made countless mistakes and I probably will continue to make them... but it's all part of the fun.. right?
