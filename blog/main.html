                <p class="date">November 14 2021</p>
                <p class="intro">                A few months after I really started getting into film my friends invited me on a spontaneous camping trip to Flaming Gorge. Flaming Gorge is a reservoir on the border of North-East Utah and Wyoming, it’s only 4 hours away from Salt Lake City so we were planning on driving there and just sleeping in our cars. I would be driving alone so I figured it would be a great time to bring as much photo gear as possible so that I could stop at every remotely interesting location along the way.</p>

                <p class="date">November 9 2021</p>
                <p class="intro">                Well this is a post that I dreaded writing and have re-written a few times by now. This post almost made me not want to continue blogging. BUT, I really want to discuss my whole venture into film photography and all things related so I figure it’s time to bite the bullet and sit down and write about a digital camera.  Let’s see... It’s 5:50PM right now and I’ll write the time when I finish and hopefully it won’t be longer than ~30 minutes… I really want to be done with this post to move onto more exciting topics, I’ve stalled on it for way too longThe topic of todays post is of course my old Fuji X100T. It’s a fantastic camera that didn’t work out.</p>

                <p class="intro">                This type of post is a first from me because I’m writing it the day of. This is new for me mainly because I’ve been trying to catch up and write posts from a little while ago when I first started shooting film. If you’re wondering I still haven’t caught up, this is just a little pause and jump to the present. This kind of post is also new and probably kind of rare because all my photos from today were digital, so I didn’t have to wait for development and scanning. All I had to do was edit them! Which… even with me that can take a few weeks, so I’m stoked that I got these all done today.</p>

                <p class="intro">                Hopefully you have seen my Instagram by now, if not I will shamelessly plug it and put a link here (go to my Instagram). If you scroll through it you will see a lot of color and every now and then black and white. Black and white doesn’t get a ton of representation on my feed mainly because I try to keep my gallery color coordinated but also because I don’t shoot it as much as I should.</p>

                <p class="title"> <a href=posts/7.html> EARLY SIGNS OF GEAR ACQUISITION SYNDROME</a></p>
                <p class="date">September 28 2021</p>
                <p class="intro">                I’ve written as if I really had only two cameras in my past posts. The Nikon FG and Nikon F3, but if you read the image captions, you’d know I do in fact own a few others. One of the plagues of a gear intensive hobby like photography is an obsession with new equipment. Gear Acquisition Syndrome (GAS) happens when you can’t stop buying new gear either for the improvement of new tech or the excitement of using something different. There’s really no end to gear acquisition syndrome, and with decades worth of secondhand analogue bodies it’s a very dangerous thing to acquire. Right around the time of my trips to Escalante I had four 35mm bodies and a digital camera, I had an arsenol of Nikon F mounts and I was beginning to check eBay and KSL on a regular basis.The analog cameras that I had were the Nikon FG, Nikon FA, Nikon FM2 and Nikon F3. My digital camera was the Fuji X100T and my lenses were a Nikkor 50mm, Nikkor 35mm, Series E 28mm, and Series E 100mm. At the time that I purchased all those things I thought that I had a specific need for it… I wasn’t satisfied with the consumer functionality of the FG, so I felt like I needed to upgrade to an F3. Since I was departing the cheap FG I need a cheaper backup body for the F3 so I got the FA, and realizing that both my F3 and FA were dependent on batteries I bought the FM2. And for lenses I felt like I needed to cover the main focal lengths (28,35,50) and then I had to get a telephoto in case I wanted to do portraits.  </p>

                <p class="intro">                Last time I shared some landscape photos from Escalante, which are what you would expect to from a beautiful desert location. But one of the other fun things about Escalante, and small towns in general, is the antiquated and untouched rural architecture.  </p>

                <p class="date">September 5 2021</p>
                <p class="intro">                There are a ton of deserts around Salt Lake City and it’s pretty easy to get to cool sandy environments if you just drive a little south. I figure I will have a lot of pictures from deserts and/or trips into deserts that I will write about so I’m going to start this as a series: ‘FILM IN THE DESERT: …’. I’ll kick it off with photos from Escalante, I have been down there a few times and have a handful of photos from each visit, so I’ll split up this post into parts, but in the future, I want to have only one post per trip.  </p>

                <p class="date">August 22 2021</p>
                <p class="intro">                I wasn’t sure how to title this post because, although I love shooting with my dslr, owning one feels more like a necessity than a joy. This is because the only reason that I have a digital camera is so that I can take pictures without wasting film. If cost wasn’t a concern, I can’t think of one reason that I would prefer a digital image over a film one. However, cost is a huge concern and is ultimately the reason digital beat film.Of course digital cameras do have major advantages in a lot of areas like resolution, speed and the slew of benefits from digital files. For me though I don’t really need a fast camera that can store hundreds of photos, so for me, if I have the choice, I will always choose film.  </p>

                <p class="date">August 9 2021</p>
                <p class="intro">                When I first started out with film I rotated between expired film from amazon, the wayward pack of Kodak Gold that I found in Smiths or the Fujifilm Superia that Walmart surprisingly kept in stock. It wasn’t until I stumbled into the ‘Film’ section of eBay’s ‘Film Photography’ category that I realized the depth of available film options. This category provided an endless selection of film from deadstock Kodak emulsions to random canisters of black and white from the 1960’s. Upon this discovery I shot almost exclusively on expired film for months.  </p>

                <p class="date">July 20 2021</p>
                <p class="intro">                  My first camera, the Nikon FG, I bought as fast as I could, just to get something to shoot film with. I ordered it from eBay and I definitely overpaid. The FG is a plasticky consumer slr camera with a dedicated program mode and minimal manual controls, but it was a good enough to shoot a few rolls while I waited to get a ‘real’ film camera.  I call the Nikon F3 a ‘real’ film camera because it is all metal, built for pros and will last for a lifetime. Simply put the F3 is better than the FG. In my opinion of course. It also doesn’t help that I broke the FG a few weeks after getting the F3.  </p>

                <p class="date"> July 18 2021 </p>
                <p class="intro">   I really started shooting film in the spring of 2020. My first film photo in my Lightroom catalog is dated March 4, 2020, so I’ll count that as the start of my film obsession. Of course, that photo was not my first on film. My very first images were taken on a cheap Fujifilm disposable that my parents had bought me for a family trip to Nicaragua in 2007. Most of that roll contained pictures of my sister showing off her stuffed animal collection and blurry scenes through the rental car window. </p>
